# 3echo Technical Assessment – Hoàng Minh Hiếu

## Solution Overview
This package contains my submission for the **3echo AI Engineering Technical Assessment**, which designs a **multi-agent inventory management system** tailored for small and medium manufacturing enterprises (SMEs).  

The solution addresses **Precision Components (PC)**’s business challenges by combining:
- **Strategic Problem Reframing**: Reconciling conflicting stakeholder needs (CEO growth, CFO cash flow, Ops reliability, IT simplicity) into a unified problem statement.  
- **Competitive Positioning**: Showing why a custom AI solution provides superior ROI compared to off-the-shelf SaaS.  
- **Agent Architecture**: Four coordinated agents (Inventory Intelligence, Forecasting, Procurement Optimization, Human Collaboration Hub) with modular, scalable design.  
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Ensures context flows across workflows, departments, and decision points, enabling adaptive, explainable AI.  
- **ML Forecasting**: Gradient Boosting classification approach optimized for SME data constraints, predicting stock-outs within supplier lead time.  
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased, low-risk rollout with clear risk mitigation, change management, and adoption strategies.  

The design balances **technical sophistication** with **SME constraints** (limited IT, CSV-based ERP, small team, budget limits) while ensuring business value:  
- $32K/year shipping savings  
- $1M+ revenue continuity  
- $1.5M working capital freed
